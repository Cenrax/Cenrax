## Welcome to my Profile.

I have completed my bachelor's in Electronics and Communication Engineering from the Institute of Engineering and Management, Kolkata. I believe in continuous learning and try to find out real-life applications of whatever knowledge I have gained. I love to read scientific articles and try to keep myself updated with the latest technologies that is flourishing around the world. My area of interest is software development, applied machine learning, and cloud computing.
I have worked on several research and development projects. At present, I am a recipient of the GitHub Student Development program and has won a hackathon conducted by the Motwani Jadeja Foundation. I never restrict myself to a particular domain and believe in generalization rather than specialization.

I love to read books and gain insights and ideas into various domains from hardware to software. 



#### I am a great fan of distributed learning and I always try to explore and create application which can be made with limited power resources or I can say an application which can be cumulatively built.
