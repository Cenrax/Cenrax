## Welcome to my Profile.

I have completed my bachelor's in Electronics and Communication Engineering from the Institute of Engineering and Management, Kolkata. I believe in continuous learning and try to find out real-life applications of whatever knowledge I have gained. I love to read scientific articles and try to keep myself updated with the latest technologies that is flourishing around the world. 

I love to read books and gain insights and ideas into various domains from hardware to software. 



#### I am a great fan of parallel processing and optimizing stuffs and I always try to explore and create application which can be made with limited power resources or I can say an application which can be cumulatively built.
