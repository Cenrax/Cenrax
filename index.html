                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I am currently working as a Principal AI Engineer focused mainly on building scalable AI solutions. My expertise lies in developing production-grade AI products. My research and innovations focus on making Large Language Models (LLMs) compute efficient and creating low-latency inference stacks.</p>
                <p>I am also dedicated to enhancing the reliability and security of LLMs, having deployed various guardrails to make these models more secure. I am passionate about Applied Machine Learning, Statistics, and NLP, and I strive to stay updated in these fields.</p>
                <p>I have completed my bachelor's in Electronics and Communication Engineering from the Institute of Engineering and Management, Kolkata. I believe in continuous learning and am always looking for real-life applications of the knowledge I've gained.</p>
